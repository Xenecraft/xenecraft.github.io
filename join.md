For access to the Xenecraft Multiplayer World, contact one of the Admins of the server or make a reference via a friend of the admins! For the safety of our members, we have the whitelist turned on (this way there is a much lower chance of griefing).

For those of you who are stepping into a Minecraft world for the first time, things may seem difficult or overwhelming. For <span class="greened">XeneCraft</span>, you can jump straight into playing and do whatever you desire. For those who may need help setting up and getting started, <strong>assuming that you are whitelisted</strong>, this is the guide for you! 

<ol>
<li>From the Minecraft start screen, click on the Multiplayer button and then click "Add Server."</li>

<li>You should see this screen pop up and simply fill out the information in the "Server Address" with <strong>play.xenecraft.com</strong> the same as in the picture below.</li>

<li>Now you can join the server and when you first log in, your will be blooped down into the spawn area. It may be a 4-entranced Stone Slabbed building that may is close to a friend's town. Read the rules or more <a href="/about-us">about us!</a></li>
<li>Once you exit our potentially-weird-spawn building, you MAY be given a <strong>Wooden Pickaxe</strong> and a <strong>Wooden Sword</strong> to help you on your journey if there are some admins hanging around.</li>
<li>Now you can choose to explore the town, settle around, make some friends, or go further and create your own awesome village. The adventurous choice is yours!</li>
</ol>
We look forward to seeing you on our server!<br>
