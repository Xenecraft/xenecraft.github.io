Heya Xeney-Crafters,
<br>
We've just updated the server to the most recent version <strong>1.15.1</strong>, as you can see in the sidebar. This newest version brings much more stability and performance to your experience. The 1.14 release was known as one of the worst performing releases yet and with this updated to PaperMC as a fork of Spigot, we should see better results overall. This is just a brief update post to notify you all more about our progress and the slow trickle as we attempt to stay up-to-date with feature and functionality.
<br><br>
Again, if any issues occur, notify us immediately since there may still be some instability with the newest release of Buzzy Bees. If you are not whitelisted on the server, give us a heads up with your IGN and then you'll be on your way to play!
