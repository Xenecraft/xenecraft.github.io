Hey Players!
<br>
It's been a long time coming but we are finally (seemingly) on a stable version of 1.16.1. In the process of trying to upgrade the server, I've gone down a large rabbit hole of research in trying to get everything up-to-date. As the server manager, with every new version that Mojang releases, it's necessity to do a `--forceUpgrade` or else things could get really messy, with incompatibility or plugins.

Over the span of this entire week, some frustration, many hours of research, long build times, and testing copies of your server, I've come across two tools <a href="https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector">mcaselector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Fenixin/Minecraft-Region-Fixer">Minecraft Region Fixer</a>. With the help of these two applications, I was able to delete the corrupted chunks, or ones that haven't been explored for more than 15 minutes. To the best of my ability and eyes, I've double checked the areas that weren't selected and made sure your builds were not nuked.  As you can see in the screenshot below, there were a ton of errors, and this is just for the overworld (not counting the Nether and End).

It seems that over the years, and from some potential neglect of our previous provider, certain areas of the world were indeed corrupted and were causing us some large issues. There were crashes, times where our server ran out of space because Hosts would share the Xenecraft's storage with other servers. There could have been hiccups with plugins, crashing when you visited certain areas, and other unfun things that even I may not even be aware about.

What does all this mean for you? Now, your experience should be much smoother with potential surprises. 
<ul>
<li>Coming all the way from version 1.12 to 1.16, many areas of the map can now be re-explored and you can see some really cool regenerated regions.</li>
<li>For creatives out there, issues with Command Blocks have also been resolved, you should now be able to use them without any issue!</li>
<li>The (Dynmap) World Map has also been reset and needs to be re-explored once again to display your awesome creations.</li>
</ul>
If any issues happen to arise from this major upgrade, please don't hesitate to contact us and we'll try and figure it out.
