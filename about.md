<b><span style="color:#4CAF50;">XeneCraft</span></b> is family friendly; we accept all age groups as long as they follow our simple rules. The server is semi-vanilla survival, with anti-grief mods to ensure the safety and fun of our players. Admins are friendly and very mature with handling things that go on with the server. We take care of our members because we care! If you have any questions about XeneCraft don't hesitate to ask!

<h2>Joining the Server</h2>
Contact one of the Admins of the server or make a reference via a friend of the admins! For the safety of our members, we have the whitelist turned on (this way there is a much lower chance of griefing).

<span class="strikethrough">NOTE: IF YOU ARE JOINING US THE FIRST TIME. MENTION "<em>MCFORUM</em>" TO OUR ADMINS AND YOU GET AN IRON SET OF TOOLS AND SWORD TO START YOU OUT.</span>
