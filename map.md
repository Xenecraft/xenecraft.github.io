If the map has been blank for awhile, please explicitly travel to <a href="http://xenecraft.com/xenecraft-world-map/">http://xenecraft.com/xenecraft-world-map/</a>.

Just like with Google Maps, you can similarly interact with the map below:
<ul>
<li>Drag the areas around to see more of the Xenecraft World Server</li>
<li>Hover over the dark right area of the map, view the explored areas of the Overworld, Nether, and End</li>
<li>In Map Types, click on a different coloured square and display the map at a different angle with heights and structures</li>
<li>Under Map Types, in the Players section, if someone is on, click on their name and center the map right on them</li>
</ul>
